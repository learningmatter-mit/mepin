# MEPIN
This repository provides the code for MEP Inference Network (MEPIN), a model for transferable learning of reaction pathways.
For details, see the preprint: [Transferable Learning of Reaction Pathways from Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15370).

> [!NOTE]
> The code is currently under final preparation and will be uploaded here in a week.
